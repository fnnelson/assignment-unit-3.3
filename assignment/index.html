    <li>
      I get a little nervous about accidentally writing an infinite loop, so I'm trying to think out the logic a few times before refreshing the console. Are there any methods we can use to check whether our code is going to result in an infinite loop? Also what's the best way to stop it so the computer doesn't explode? (worst case scenario I know)
    </li>
    <li>
      I know it's a little early for this, since we're just learning the foundational JavaScript stuff, but what's a basic example of how a loop is used in the real world? I see some practicality in the scenarios from the Stretch Goals, but I'm just curious if there's anything you remember from a previous job where a loop was used. If this will all be covered in the future, I can wait on that, as I'm just curious after going through the lessons and assignment.
